# BAD MODS BAD

I consider modules to be a mistake, simply because they change the stats without
changing the feeling of a building. They all feel like cheats. I think scaling
into lategame is much more satisfying when it's done through more imposing and
better machines and larger scale. Unfortunately, I'm not a very good modder so
this mod just removes the effects of all modules and the module slots of all
buildings. Modules are now just components.

In order to compensate for that a little and still allow large factories to run
efficiently, I've added a setting to scale some buildings to act as several of
their original versions. That means their speed, but also their recipe cost,
energy cost and pollution were increased by the same factor so that effectively,
the only balance change is the amount of space a factory takes.
